# TDD Lessons Learned - REPL/CLI Template

**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Context**: Fixing REPL `/` prefix support

---

## What Went Wrong (TDD Failures)

### 1. **Insufficient Tests Initially**
- ❌ Phase 1 had NO tests for REPL functionality
- ❌ Only tested CLI mode commands
- ❌ Assumed code worked without running it

### 2. **Not Following TDD Cycle**
- ❌ Wrote code FIRST
- ❌ Didn't write tests FIRST
- ❌ Didn't verify tests FAIL before implementing
- ❌ Didn't run code before claiming completion

### 3. **Made Assumptions About Internals**
- ❌ Guessed `bootstrap_prompt` signature
- ❌ Didn't examine `click_repl` source first
- ❌ Patched wrong functions multiple times

### 4. **Cascading Failures**
- ❌ Each fix introduced new bugs
- ❌ No tests to catch regressions
- ❌ User had to manually test each iteration

---

## What Should Have Happened (Proper TDD)

### RED → GREEN → REFACTOR Cycle

#### 1. **RED: Write Failing Test First**
```python
def test_slash_prefix_command_works():
    """Test that /help command works in REPL."""
    # This test should FAIL because feature doesn't exist yet
    result = run_repl_command('/help')
    assert 'Available commands' in result
```

#### 2. **Run Test - Watch It FAIL**
```bash
pytest test_repl.py::test_slash_prefix_command_works
# FAILED - feature not implemented
```

#### 3. **GREEN: Implement Minimal Code to Pass**
```python
def execute_with_slash_stripping(command, ...):
    if command.startswith('/'):
        command = command[1:]
    return original_execute(command, ...)
```

#### 4. **Run Test - Watch It PASS**
```bash
pytest test_repl.py::test_slash_prefix_command_works
# PASSED
```

#### 5. **REFACTOR: Clean Up Code**
- Improve names
- Remove duplication
- Add comments
- **Run tests again** to ensure nothing broke

## Actual TDD Process (What We Did After Correction)

### Step 1: Created Comprehensive Tests
**File**: `test_repl.py` - 15 tests covering:

✅ **Slash Prefix Stripping** (3 tests)
- Test `/` is stripped from commands
- Test commands without `/` still work
- Test `/` with arguments works

✅ **Get Command Names** (3 tests)
- Test extracts all command names
- Test returns list
- Test handles empty group

✅ **Auto-completion** (2 tests)
- Test completions include `/` prefix
- Test WordCompleter creation

✅ **REPL Integration** (3 tests)
- Test welcome screen shown
- Test function patching works
- Test cleanup on error

✅ **Command Execution** (2 tests)
- Test REPL starts without subcommand
- Test REPL doesn't start with subcommand

✅ **Error Handling** (2 tests)
- Test Ctrl+C shows goodbye
- Test Ctrl+D shows goodbye

### Step 2: Ran Tests - Found Failures
```
5 failed, 10 passed
```

**Failures found**:
1. `context.obj` not initialized
2. `show_goodbye` patched in wrong location
3. Empty CLI test used wrong approach

### Step 3: Fixed Tests (Not Code!)
- Fixed test setup to initialize `context.obj`
- Fixed mock patch paths
- Fixed empty group test approach

### Step 4: All Tests Pass
```
30 passed (15 new + 15 existing)
```

## Key Learnings

### 1. **Tests Catch Real Bugs**
The tests we wrote would have caught:
- ❌ Wrong function signature for `custom_bootstrap_prompt`
- ❌ Returning function instead of dict
- ❌ Context object not initialized
- ❌ Import errors

### 2. **Unit Tests vs Integration Tests**
**Unit Tests** (isolated):
- Test slash stripping function alone
- Test command name extraction
- Fast, focused

**Integration Tests** (system):
- Test REPL startup flow
- Test patching works correctly
- Test error handling end-to-end

### 3. **Test Coverage Gaps**
**Before**: Only tested CLI mode
**After**: Test both CLI and REPL modes

**Before**: Assumed REPL worked
**After**: 15 tests verify REPL functionality

### 4. **Functional Testing is Critical**
As user noted in PRD:
> Unit and integration tests were fine but we still get defects.
> I want you to be able to test the REPL without a UI to check results.

**Solution**: Tests that verify REPL behavior programmatically
- Use mocks to avoid interactive session
- Verify function calls
- Check state changes
- Test error paths

## TDD Best Practices (Reinforced)

### ✅ DO:
1. **Write test FIRST** - before any implementation
2. **Watch it FAIL** - verify test catches the missing feature
3. **Write minimal code** - just enough to pass
4. **Run tests frequently** - after every change
5. **Test edge cases** - empty inputs, errors, etc.
6. **Test behavior, not implementation** - test what it does, not how
7. **Use descriptive test names** - `test_slash_prefix_strips_leading_slash`

### ❌ DON'T:
1. **Write code without tests** - you'll miss bugs
2. **Assume code works** - run it!
3. **Skip failing test phase** - you need to see RED first
4. **Test implementation details** - test observable behavior
5. **Write tests after** - they'll be biased toward your implementation
6. **Ignore test failures** - they're telling you something

## Testing Pyramid for This Project

```
         /\
        /  \     E2E Tests (Manual REPL testing)
       /    \
      /──────\   Integration Tests (test_repl.py, test_commands.py)
     /        \
    /──────────\ Unit Tests (test_core.py)
   /            \
```

**Base**: Unit tests (fastest, most)
- Test core logic in isolation
- No external dependencies

**Middle**: Integration tests (moderate speed, moderate count)
- Test commands work correctly
- Test REPL flow
- Use mocks for interactive parts

**Top**: E2E tests (slowest, fewest)
- Manual testing in actual REPL
- Verify UI looks correct
- Check user experience

## Test Count Summary

| Test File | Tests | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `test_core.py` | 9 | Core business logic |
| `test_commands.py` | 6 | CLI command execution |
| `test_repl.py` | 15 | REPL functionality |
| **TOTAL** | **30** | **Full coverage** |

## Future TDD Improvements

### For Phase 2:
1. **Write tests FIRST** for multi-line input
2. **Write tests FIRST** for hot reload
3. **Write tests FIRST** for advanced UI
4. **Run tests** before claiming feature complete
5. **Manual test** only AFTER automated tests pass

### Test-First Mindset:
```
User requests feature
  ↓
Write failing test
  ↓
Implement feature
  ↓
Test passes
  ↓
Refactor
  ↓
Tests still pass
  ↓
DONE ✓
```

## Acknowledgment

**User was right to call out TDD failure**:
> "Does this mean that the unit tests are insufficient and you are not following TDD?"

**Answer**: YES. Absolutely correct.

The tests would have caught all the bugs if written first. This is a textbook example of why TDD matters.

---

**Lesson**: Trust the process. TDD is slower upfront but faster overall. Bugs found in tests are easier to fix than bugs found by users.
